TextTeaser
==========

TextTeaser is an automatic summarization algorithm that combines the power of natural language processing and machine learning to produce good results.

Try out TextTeaser [here](http://www.textteaser.com/). Or the API [here](https://www.mashape.com/mojojolo/textteaser).

##### TextTeaser can be used to:

1. Provide a gist of what an article is all about. 
2. Provide better previews in news readers 
3. Provide summaries for your blog. 
4. Anything a developer can think of.

### Requirements

[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) is needed for TextTeaser to run.
Use of [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/) is recommended

### Setup

1. git clone https://github.com/MojoJolo/textteaser.git
2. sbt compile
3. sbt eclipse // If using Eclipse.
4. sbt run
5. 

### Configuration

By default, TextTeaser uses MongoDB to record keywords, categories and some article types.
To disable this, set `dummyKeywordService` to `false` in the `GuiceModule` used to configure the summarizer, e.g.

    val config = new Config
    val guice = new ScalaInjector(
      Guice.createInjector(
          new GuiceModule(
              config,
              dummyKeywordService=true
          )
      )
    )
    
    val summarizer = guice.instance[Summarizer]
    ...
